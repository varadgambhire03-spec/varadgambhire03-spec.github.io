## About Me

I am a third-semester B.Tech CSE student specializing in Cybersecurity. My passion lies at the critical intersection of software development and application security.

As I begin my journey into full-stack development, my core focus is on mastering the principles of "Secure by Design." I am not just learning to code; I am learning to build applications that are fundamentally secure from the ground up.

My goal is to bridge the gap between development and security, aiming for a career as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) with a deep specialization in Application Security (AppSec) and DevSecOps.

## Projects

* **[Password Strength Checker](https://github.com/varadgambhire03-spec/Password-Strength-Checker)**
    * A Python script that analyzes a password's strength based on length, character types, and complexity.

## Education
* **B.Tech, Computer Science & Engineering (Cybersecurity)**
* [Your University Name] (Expected Graduation 2028)
